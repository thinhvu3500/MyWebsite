				<p>If I have to say, I have a lot of hobbies. Playing games, soccer, reading books, watching movies, etc. I can also play musical instruments: guitar and electronic keyboard, but I am more confident on my guitar skills, and I usually play it in my free time. I enjoy playing games the most, I believe this is the most common mean of entertainment for a lot of people. Related to that, there is something you may find interesting about me, and that is my passion for the game League of Legends (LOL). Like most teenagers in Vietnam, I like this game a lot, though I don't have the skills to conquer it, but I like to watch professional players perform in domestic as well as international tournaments. I try to analyze their gameplays and the strategies they use when I watch them, and I can successfully read the moves. So if things go sideways with my career in the future, an e-sports coach or an e-sports analyst is my back-up plan.</p>

		    					<p>I want to pursue IT career because I want to know everything, I do not want to be outdated because of my lack in knowledge. It annoys me when there is something that happens daily in our lives but I cannot seem to understand it. Everyone can agree that information and knowledge are powerful tools to help us achieve anything in our lives. IT provides almost everything we need to know in this modern world. Therefore, data analytics is the field that I am most interested about. I like working with numbers, statistic and most importantly, the data.</p>

		    					<p>I had access to computer since I was 4 or 5 years of age and I liked to mess around with my computer, I kept digging the files and look for anything I want on the Internet. With a big curiosity, I wondered what makes the computer and the Internet, who controls them and how do them work. I kept those questions along with me until I was older and be able to understand the IT world. The definition of IT jobs only came to my mind 3 years ago, at first, I did not take the thought seriously, but then, my uncle, who is working in an IT environment, encouraged me to follow the IT path. I took his advice, and now I am here.</p>

		    					<span class="date" style="font-size: 1.25em">Job Description</span>
		    					<p>I want to be a Data Analyst in the near future, then after years of experience, Data Scientist is my final goal. The most interesting part of this job for me is that the worker has to work with raw information, numbers and turns them into something meaningful for business organizations. Frankly speaking, the purpose of this job is selling the (appropriate) information for anyone who needs them. Personally, I believe this job requires traits from employees to best-suited for qualifications. Firstly, is patience, this is extremely important because you have to spend most of your time to gather information, filter, and make use of them. For example, you want to build a model which can predict the price of houses or apartments, you will have to gather houses data from various sources, and each source saves data in different structures, so eventually you will have to unify them in a single, mutual structure. Furthermore, the data needed filtering so that the final results are meaningful, selected information. Secondly, the job requires excellent communication skill because you have to work with different departments efficiently, such as the business teams, engineer teams, etc. And finally, it does matter that the person is fascinated by finding and trying new things to keep him/her up to date.</p>
								<p>A data analyst should have a wide range of knowledge about machine learning, database, programming languages, and visualization. For me, 3 most crucial skills any data analyst must have are solid background of mathematics, the ability to program software properly, and sensitivity. Mathematics skills are needed for machine learning, handling the raw data, and they could be helpful for learning new things. Moreover, data analysts sometimes need to develop their own application to retrieve and process data so programming skills are highly-required. Sensitivity allows you to identify the right methods to deal with any kind of data, it could be developed through times and years of experiences in the job.</p>
								<p>At the moment, I am an undergraduate and I am aware that I still have a long way to meet those requirements. However, I am confident in my mathematics background and I can do a little bit of coding so my plan is to study hard at RMIT firstly. During the course, I can strengthen my coding skills as well as mathematics knowledge. I think I will dig deep into linear algebra, probability, derivatives, integrals, machine learning, data mining, database: SQL, noSQL, some programming languages such as C/C++, Java, and then focus more on Python. Those are my objectives besides the lectures and tests in RMIT. After the graduation milestone, I would like to work for 2 or 3 years in the field for gaining job experiences, then I will aim for the Master Degree related to the wanted job. This is my plan for the upcoming 5 years, though it may be changed over time.</p>

I only become a team leader when I feel comfortable with the task given, my motto is let the most suitable one handle the problem, proficiency is my first priority. I am very open to ideas, and I only conduct if the benefits outweigh risks, I am not a risk taker. I want to play safe and steady, if I have to say, within a team, I would be the team anchor to keep my mates on their toes.</p>

Within a team, I can undertake any given task, even if I have to learn and improvise to accomplish the goal. I would do anything for my team because the team's benefits is my highest priority.</p>

				<p>To be honest, I am still cannot decide what my project would be, but if I have to choose then it could be a chatterbot (or chatbot). This chatterbot will be implemented in Discord as an assistant for gaming community, or simply just a group of friends who wants to have fun while communicating online. I plan to include some relevant features such as speech-to-text and text-to-speech software, or playback recorded voicemail of the members within the group when it recognizes certain keywords to activate. Imagine how much fun it would bring to people while they are having fun with each other, and that is just double the fun!</p>

				<span class="date" style="font-size: 1.5em">Motivation</span>
				<p>I play games with my friends a lot, and we always use Discord to communicate instead of in-game voice chat because it is clearly better, and more stable. We wanted to implement a Discord bot for so long, we even spent time on discussing the features this chatbot could have. Unfortunately, this plan has never been proceeded because everyone is busy with schools, works and personal matters. Then it comes to this project, and I thought to myself, this could be the greatest opportunity to develop a chatterbot as we intended to do for months. I really want to have this chatterbot done and I could not be happier if there is someone who wants the same thing as me and we can do this together as our project.</p>

				<p>Like all other chatbots, this one has to have the welcoming new member feature. It will send a welcome message and a guide to access all possible features in the server. Moreover, not just new members, current members also receive a welcome notification (sarcastically) when they log in. Then the bot would ask the member what will they want to do, it can either respond to the members' decision or just trolling them by replies messages like "yeah, not interested" or "then what does this have to do with me?". I intended to divert this chatbot to be more humane, having the ability to express various emotions throughout the conversation with human members.</p>
				<p>I also want to implement voice recognition function to this bot, when a member voice chat on the channel, it can identify which user is talking and interact with him/her. In the future, when I have done my research, this bot can playback recorded audio provided by the users. Users can record anything such as their own voices or online-downloaded audio track and prepare the script for the bot to respond to them when they are talking. The purpose of this feature is to create a feeling of communicating with your friends even though they are not online. One of the best way to achieve this is to record each one's most signature lines (something only the person says and recognized by his/her friends).</p>
				<p>Another attribute I want to add to the bot is the ability to respond to messages. For example, let's say I want my bot to listen for users telling each other "Happy Birthday", then the bot will also chime in the messages "Happy Birthday" to the user on the channel. Not only text messages, I plan to make it respond to voice messages as well. As an extension for this function, handling events is something worth considering for me. A reminder of upcoming events ( Steam sale events) or celebrating birthdays, holidays would be very nice for everyone in the server.</p>
				<p>And last but not least, music player feature, the bot will be able to play, skip and stop the music and will also support queuing functionality. The bot can reading chat and listening to voice chat messages and responding to them by adding songs, then it will play the music. It can play music from YouTube, Soundcloud, Twitch, and direct links, also I want it supports customized playlists for different users. The need for music while playing games are one of the most basic things to boost you up, to help you enjoy your game more. And having the opportunity to customize your own playlists is really pleasurable for users.</p>

				<span class="date" style="font-size: 1.5em">Tools and Technologies</span>
				<p>Building this chatterbot requires a personal computer (PC), Discord, of course, programming languages (choose any languages you feel most comfortable with to code), and Node.js - it is a JavaScript runtime that is free and open source, you will need it to make bot actually work. You will also need a text editor program, it does not need to be fancy or a really powerful one, just Notepad++ is enough, and it is free to download as well. Other relevant open source tools can be mentioned as Dialogflow (formerly Api.ai), a chatbot creation service from Google, its standard edition is free and covers the need of most developers.</p>

				<span class="date" style="font-size: 1.5em">Skills Required</span>
				<p>To make a chatbot, you have to know coding, any language is fine but I suggest Python and JavaScript, they are best suited for beginners. If you really commit to this, skills related to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning would be very helpful, as chatbot is also a form of virtual assistant. Besides coding, scripting skills are there to be considered, scripting languages such as JavaScript are used to create Discord bots regularly. The software to make a chatbot are mostly free to use, but the skills related must be learnt and developed, you have to invest your time, maybe even money to sharpen your skills.</p>

				<span class="date" style="font-size: 1.5em">Outcome</span>
				<p>If this project is successful, the result will be an advent of a characteristic Discord chatbot which runs your Discord channels. This chatbot is made to customize your intentions, it could be a multi-function bot that can do a lot of things, or it could be a really dumb bot which cannot do anything besides of trolling and flaming users. As I mentioned before, the aspect I like the most about this bot is that it can store users' voices and create a playful and closed atmosphere among the members even though someone is not there with them. Our highest aim is to bring people enjoyable moments while hanging out with your friends on the Internet. You can do whatever you want with this bot, because the sky is the limit!</p>
